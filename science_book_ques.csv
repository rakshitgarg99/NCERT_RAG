2. Why is the cell called the structural and functional unit of life?,"Cells form the structure of an entity. A group of cells form a tissue, further an organ and ultimately an organ system. They perform fundamental functions and life processes such as respiration, digestion, excretion etc., in both unicellular and multicellular entities. They perform all the activities independently. Hence, cells are referred to as structural and fundamental units of life."
3. How do substances like CO2 and water move in and out of the cell? Discuss.,"CO2 moves by diffusion. The cellular waste accumulates in high concentrations in the cell, whereas the concentration of CO2 in the external surroundings is comparatively lower. This difference in the concentration level inside and outside of the cell causes the CO2 to diffuse from a region of higher (within the cell) to a lower concentration. H2O diffuses by osmosis through the cell membrane. It moves from a region of higher concentration to a lower concentrated region through a selectively permeable membrane until equilibrium is reached."
4. Why is the plasma membrane called a selectively permeable membrane?,The plasma membrane is called as a selectively permeable membrane as it permits the movement of only certain molecules in and out of the cells. Not all molecules are free to diffuse.

The nuclear region is not well defined as the nuclear membrane is absent and is referred to as the nucleoid. 3. There is a single chromosome. 4. Membrane-bound cell organelles absent. 4. Membrane-bound cell organelles present.
3. What would happen if the plasma membrane ruptures or breaks down?,"If the plasma membrane ruptures or breaks down, then molecules of some substances will freely move in and out of the cells. As the plasma membrane acts as a mechanical barrier, the exchange of material from its surroundings through osmosis or diffusion in a cell won’t take place. Consequently, the cell would die due to the disappearance of the protoplasmic material."
4. What would happen to the life of a cell if there was no Golgi apparatus?,"The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membrane-bound vesicles whose functions are as follows:  Storage of substances  Packaging of substances  Manufacture of substances Without the Golgi apparatus, the cells will be disabled from packing and dispatching materials that were produced by the cells. The Golgi apparatus is also involved in the formation of cells. Hence, in the absence of the Golgi apparatus, cells will not be produced."
5. Which organelle is known as the powerhouse of the cell? Why?,"Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. It is because it releases the energy required for different activities of life. Mitochondria releases energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules, essential for numerous chemical activities of life. Hence, ATP is often referred to as the ‘energy currency of the cell’."
6. Where do the lipids and proteins constituting the cell membrane get synthesised?,Lipids and proteins are synthesised in the ER (Endoplasmic Reticulum).
7. How does an Amoeba obtain its food?,"Through the process of endocytosis, an Amoeba obtains its food. As its cell membrane is flexible enough, food particles are engulfed, forming a food vacuole girdling it, which is assisted by the pseudopodia. Amoeba secretes digestive enzymes to bring about digestion of the engulfed particle once the food is trapped."
8. What is osmosis?,The process of movement of a water molecule from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration through a semipermeable membrane is known as osmosis.
"9. Carry out the following osmosis experiment: Take four peeled potato halves and scoop each one out to make potato cups. One of these potato cups should be made from a boiled potato. Put each potato cup in a trough containing water. Now, (a) Keep cup A empty (b) Put one teaspoon sugar in cup B (c) Put one teaspoon salt in cup C (d) Put one teaspoon sugar in the boiled potato cup D. Keep these for two hours. Then observe the four potato cups and answer the following: (i) Explain why water gathers in the hollowed portion of B and C. (ii) Why is potato A necessary for this experiment? (iii) Explain why water does not gather in the hollowed-out portions of A and D.","(i) Water accumulates in the hollowed portions of B and C as a difference in the water concentration is observed. Thereby, endosmosis occurs as the cells act as a semipermeable membrane. (ii) Potato A is essential in this experiment as it is significant to compare different scenarios seen in potato cups B, C and D. Potato A in this experiment clearly shows that the potato cavity on its own cannot bring about water movement. (iii) Cup in A does not show any change in the water flow concentration for osmosis to occur, which requires concentration to be higher than the other. Cells in cup D are dead; thus, there is no existence of a semipermeable membrane for water flow. Consequently, osmosis does not occur."

5. Which tissue makes up the husk of a coconut?,"The sclerenchymatous tissue, which is a type of permanent tissue makes up the husk of the coconut. These tissues causes the plant to become stiff and hard. The cells of this tissue are dead and their cell walls are thickened because of the presence of lignin."
6. What are the constituents of phloem?,"The phloem constitutes of the following four elements, they are: ➢ Sieve tube ➢ Companion cells ➢ Phloem parenchyma ➢ Phloem fibres"
7. Name the tissue responsible for movement of our body.,"Two tissues jointly are responsible for the movement of our body, namely: ➢ Muscular tissue ➢ Nervous tissue"
8. What does a neuron look like?,"A neuron is a nerve cell consisting of the cell body with a nucleus and cytoplasm from which a long and thin hair-like structure emerges. Every neuron has one elongated part known as the axon, and several short and small branched structures known as dendrites. A single neuron can even be a meter long."
9. Give three features of cardiac muscles.,Cardiac muscles are specialized tissues that are evolved to pump blood throughout the body. The following are the features of cardiac muscles: ➢ They are cylindrical in shape. ➢ Striated muscle fibres. ➢ They are uninucleated and branched. ➢ These muscles are involuntary in nature.
10. What are the functions of areolar tissue?,"Areolar tissues are typically observed in animals. They are connective tissues and are found in between skin and muscles. They are also located around blood vessels and nerves, and are present in the bone marrow. The space inside the organs is filled with these tissues. They support the delicate internal organs and assist in tissue repair in case of damage."
"4. Differentiate between parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma on the basis of their cell wall.",The following are the differences between different tissues based on cell wall: ➢ Parenchyma: Cell walls are thin and made up of cellulose. ➢ Collenchyma: Cell walls are thick at the edges due to the deposition of pectin. ➢ Sclerenchyma: Cell walls are thick due to the deposition of lignin.
5. What are the functions of the stomata?,"Stomata are the tiny pores present on the outer layer of the cells, the epidermis. Stomata bring about the exchange of gases and transpiration."
6. Show the difference between the three types of muscle fibres diagrammatically.,"There are three types of muscle fibres, they are: 1. Cardiac muscles: • Present in the heart. • Involuntary in nature. • They have 1 nucleus. • The muscle fibers are branched. 2. Smooth muscles: • Found in lungs and alimentary canal. • Involuntary in nature. • They have 1 nucleus. • They are spindle-shaped. 3. Striated muscles: • They are connected with bones. • Voluntary in nature. • They are long and cylindrical muscle fibers. • They possess many nuclei. • Striated muscles are unbranched."
7. What is the specific function of the cardiac muscle?,The cardiac muscles are branched and cylindrical. They are uninucleated and are involuntary in nature. The cardiac muscles bring about a rhythmic contraction and relaxation throughout one’s lifetime.
"8. Differentiate between striated, un-striated, and cardiac muscles on the basis of their structure and site/location in the body.","The following are the differences between different types of muscles, based on their structure and location in the body. ➢ Character: Striated muscles "
1. Define the term ’tissue’.,"A tissue is defined as a cluster of cells, which are similar in structure and work together to perform a particular function. Un-striated muscles 	 Cardiac muscles ➢ Shape/Structure: Long, cylindrical, non-tapering. They are un-branched. 	 Long and tapering. They are un-branched. 	 Cylindrical and non-tapering. They are branched. ➢ Location in body: Hands, legs and skeletal muscles 	 Wall of stomach, intestine, ureter and bronchi 	 Heart ➢ Dark and light: Present 	 Absent 	 Present but less"
2. How many types of elements together make up the xylem tissue? Name them.,"The xylem tissue is made up of four main elements, namely: ➢ Vessels ➢ Tracheids ➢ Xylem fibres ➢ Xylem parenchyma"
3. How are simple tissues different from complex tissues in plants?,The following are the differences: ➢ Simple tissues: They are made up of a single type of cell that performs only one common function. ➢ Complex tissues: They are made up of more than one kind of cell that coordinate to perform one particular function.
(a) Tissue that forms the inner lining of our mouth ," The epithelial tissue, Squamous epithelium."
(b) Tissue that connects muscle to bone in humans , Tendon.
(c) Tissue that transports food in plants , Phloem.
(d) Tissue that stores fat in our body , Adipose tissue.
(e) Connective tissue with a fluid matrix ," Blood, it is a fluid connective tissue."
(f) Tissue present in the brain , Nervous tissue.
Skin , Stratified squamous epithelial tissue.
Bark of tree , Protective tissue and cork.
Bone , Connective tissue.
Lining of kidney tubule , Cuboidal epithelial tissue.
Vascular bundle ," Conducting tissue (xylem and phloem), complex permanent tissue."
12. Name the regions in which parenchyma tissue is present ," The parenchyma is found in: The pith of stems and roots; when parenchyma contains chlorophyll, it is called chlorenchyma (found in green leaves); parenchyma in aquatic plants has large air cavities (called aerenchyma) that enable them to float."
13. What is the role of epidermis in plants? ," The epidermis in plants forms an uninterrupted and continuous layer that has no intercellular spaces, providing protection."
14. How does the cork act as a protective tissue? ," Cork cells are dead and densely arranged, with no intercellular spaces. The deposition of suberin on the cell walls makes them impervious to water and gases."
